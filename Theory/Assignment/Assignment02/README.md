This assignment is a follow up on Assignment01 and requires us to modify, and improve the code to store multiple user profiles for your final project.
I have modified Project01 file and added spinners(pre-populated drop down buttons) to choose inputs from them.
--In my project, I have created a new empty activity where I have coded and implemented Lateral Navigation(Tabbed View). There are 3 tabs, namely

-  Student Information
-  University Affiliation, and
-  Phone Number

Each Tab contains a fragment where Students' Information show up. I have added two FAB buttons to the second and third Fragment that opens up yet another Fragments that take Inputs from the Users and saves them. 

There are many features to be implemented yet. I have not been able to invoke Fragments when the FAB buttons are clicked using "onClick" method that needs to be fixed. 
The project is still incomplete and will be worked on to meet all requirements.
